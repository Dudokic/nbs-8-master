    "**LangChain** is a software development framework designed to simplify the creation of applications that use large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT. It's written in Python and JavaScript, and it was launched as an open-source project in October 2022 by Harrison Chase, a developer working at the machine learning startup Robust Intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework offers a broad range of capabilities and features for developers, allowing them to harness the power of LLMs for a variety of applications. Here are some key features of LangChain:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ease of Use**: LangChain simplifies the process of integrating LLMs into applications. This makes it easier for developers to create and deploy applications that leverage language models for a variety of tasks, including document analysis, text summarization, and chatbot functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flexibility**: LangChain includes integrations with a variety of systems and services, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Azure cloud storage; API wrappers for news, movie information, and weather; and support for multiple web scraping subsystems and templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chain Mechanism:** At the heart of LangChain is the \"Chain\" mechanism, which is a sequence of operations that are performed on a given input. The output of one operation can be used as the input for the next, allowing for complex, multi-step processes to be created and executed easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Functionality:** LangChain supports the concept of a memory for chain objects, allowing data to persist across multiple calls. This makes the chain a stateful object, which can be useful for certain types of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customizable Chains:** While LangChain provides many predefined chains, developers also have the flexibility to create custom chains tailored to their specific needs. This can be done by subclassing the Chain class and implementing the required methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why we use Langchain ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Langchain is a python library that helps you interact with LLMs like ChatGPT and connect it external data and apps."
